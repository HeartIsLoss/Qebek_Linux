Intro:

  Sebek exports UDP packets on the LAN to a data collection host which sniffs
  them off the LAN using an application based on libpcap.  The extraction app, 
  called sbk_extract is told what interface to sniff on and what destination port
  number ot look for(or what tcpdump file to read). 

  As packets are processed,  a binary representation of the 
  Sebek record is output to standard out.  This output is then piped to the input 
  of a utility called sbk_upload.pl, which uploads this data into a Mysql database
  or into a utility called sbk_ks_log.pl, which writes keystroke logs to standard out.

Building:

  - ./configure
  - make
  - make install



Running:

  sbk_extract can pull sebek packets from libpcap file or from
  network interface. As it does so, it sends each record to standard out.

  Options include:

	-i device, if you are sniffing from the network this
		specifies which interface.

	-f file, if you are reading from pcap file, this specifies
		which file, you can read from file, or read from
		net
	
	-p port, specified what Destination UDP port to look for

        -u username, username to setuid to.

        -c path, path of chroot jail.




  sebekd.pl is designed to operate on the roo, it controls all
  aspects of running sbk_extract and uploading sebek data into
  the hflow database.
 

  skb_diag.pl is a raw formater of out put from sbk_extract, it	
  creates barely human readable output

  sbk_ks_log.pl write only the keystroke logs to standard out.  It has no options.

  Example:

	sbk_extract -i eth1 -p 1101 | sbk_ks_log.pl 


  sbk_viewer.pl is similar to sbk_ks_log.pl but it also allows you to view the
  experimental write data
  	 


Adding functionality:

  If you dont like the existing database or want to write some sorta of custom tool
  to munge the Sebek records, then the best place to get a decent data feed is
  directly from the output of sbk_extract.

  The record format exported by sbk_extract is the following:

 ($ip,$magic,$ver,$counter,$time_sec,$time_usec,$pid,$uid,$fd,$com,$len) =
            unpack("NNnnNNNNNNa10N",$line);

  read(STDIN,$data,$len,0);


	IP address: 	32bit unsigned
	MAGIC Val:	32bit unsigned
        Sebek Ver:	16bit unsigned
	Type		16bit unsigned
        Counter: 	32bit unsigned
        Time_sec:	32bit unsigned
	Time_usec:	32bit unsigned	
	Proc ID:	32bit unsigned
	User ID:	32bit unsigned
	File Desc:	32bit unsigned
	Command:	12char array
	Length:		Data Length

	Data:		Variable Length data



BUGS:

	Some version of linux which have perl 5.8, which has a 
	serious bug in it.  The read function malfunctions.

	http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg92560.html

	If this problem is present, then try the following workaround

	export LANG="POSIX"

	I have NO idea as to why this resolves the issue.
